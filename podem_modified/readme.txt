1.
set the unknown value as 0 for experiment.

greedy algorithm

1. take each test vector as the start vector, and run the algorithm once.
2. compute switch activity between vector0 and vector 1,2,3,4...n-1, 
3. record the smallest switch activity value and following vector order
4. store the vector order and accumulate the switch activity value
4. return the test vector order and swich activity count
